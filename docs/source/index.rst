Welcome to aimsgb's documentation!
==================================
aimsgb is an efficient and open-source Python library for generating atomic coordinates in periodic grain boundary models. It is designed to
construct various grain boundary structures from cubic and non-cubic initial
configurations. A convenient command line tool has also been provided to enable
easy and fast construction of tilt and twist boundaries by assigining the degree
of fit (Î£), rotation axis, grain boundary plane and initial crystal structure.

We also provide a web-based GUI to access aimsgb framework: `aimsgb.org
<http://aimsgb.org/>`_
